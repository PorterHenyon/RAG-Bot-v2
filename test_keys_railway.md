# Test API Keys on Railway

To test which API keys work, run this command in Railway:

```bash
railway run python test_keys.py
```

Or if you have Railway CLI installed locally, you can run:

```bash
railway run python test_keys.py
```

This will test all your GEMINI_API_KEY and GEMINI_API_KEY_2 through GEMINI_API_KEY_20 keys and tell you which ones work.
